You can read this for knowledge
1.Selenium:
=> A library (or framework) for automating web browser actions
=> PRovides classes and methods to simulate user actions like clicking, typing, or scrolling
=> Import dependencies (like in pom.xml) to use these features in the code
=> Often called a "tool" because it helps automate and test web applications efficiently

2.Maven 
=> a build tool for Java projects
=> Helps manage project dependencies (libraries your project needs)
=> Builds the project, and ensures everything is organized properly.

3.Eclipse 
=> An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
=> It's like a workspace where you can write, run, and debug your code.
=> Makes coding easier by offering features like syntax highlighting and debugging tools.
